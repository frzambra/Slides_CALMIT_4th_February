## Context of drought in Chile

***

>- The last years Chile has been affected for different level of drought.
>- In early 2015 in Chile unusual drought conditions occurred, the central-south part of Chile was affected for drought a situation almost unprecedented.
>- On March 2015 in Chile were 194 administrative units (county) declarated under drought conditions (56% of whole country)
>- According with the fifth report of the IPCC
  - there is an increase in global temperatures. 
  - a decrease of precipitation is expected in central-south Chile.
  - a increase of droughts frequency 
>- Main problems in Chile:
  - low density of weather stations
  - there is a lack of knowledge of the impact of rainfall deficits in agriculture

## Hypothesis 

</q>
It is possible to develop a merging remote sensing products of precipitation and evapotranspiration locally using in-situ data and so improve the spatial and temporal characterization of agricultural drought in Chile

---

## Objectives

>1. Develop a merging remote sensing product of precipitation and evapotranspiration with monthly frequency from 2000 to 2015 for the watersheds of rivers Limari, Itata y Bueno.
>2. Derive drought indices based on vegetation, land surface temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration and assess the combined effect.
>3. Perform the characterization of agricultural drought

## Methodology

***

## Remote sensing data

- MODIS (Vegetation)
  - **MCD12Q1** (IGBP) : Landcover Type, 1km, yearly, 2001 - 2013.
  - **MOD13A3**  : NDVI, 1km, monthly, 2000 - 2015. 
  - **MOD11A2** : LST, 1km, 8 days, 2000 - 2015
  - **MOD16** : $ET_0$, 1km, monthly, 2000 - 2015
- Precipitation
  - **TRMM 3B43 v7**: Precipitation, 0.25&deg; , monthly, 1998 - 2015
  - **Persiann-CDR** : Precipitation, 0.25&deg; , daily, 1983 - 2015
  - **CHIRPS 2.0** : Precipitation, 0.05&deg; , monthly, 1981 - 2015

***

## Meteorological stations

- From the data base of Center for Science for Climate and Resilience (CR2) from the University of Chile (http://www.cr2.cl).
  - Precipitation : 781 station with daily and monthly data
  - Extreme temperatures : 281 stations

***

## Merging

To improve the accuracy of the precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) remote sensing products merging techniques will be used.

- Regression-Kriging (RK) : Spatial prediction of the in-situ measurements using the remote sensing product as predictor and additional information.
- Bayesian combination.

***

## Derivation of drought indices

### 2000 - 2015

- **Standardized vegetation index (SVI) :** From NDVI (MOD13A3) the standardized anomaly was calculated as:

$$SVI = \frac{NDVI -\overline{NDVI}}{NDVI_\sigma}$$

- **Vegetation condition index (VCI) :** The time series of NDVI images was smoothed using a locally-weighted polynomial regression (LOWESS), then:

$$VCI = \frac{NDVI - NDVI_{min}}{NDVI_{max}-NDVI_{min}}$$

***

## Derivation of drought indices

### 2000 - 2015

- **Temperature condition index :** The Land Surface Temperature (LST) images of 8 days was converted to monthly and then:

$$TCI = \frac{LST_{max} -LST}{LST_{max}-LST_{min}}$$

- **Vegetation health index :** Combines the response of vegetation and land surface temperature

$$VHI = 0.5\cdot VCI + 0.5 \cdot TCI$$

***

## Derivation of drought indices

### 1983/1998 - 2015

- **Precipitation Condition Index (PCI):** this index was/will calculated for monthly accumulated precipitation of 1, 3 and 6 months using the remote sensing precipitation products.

$$PCI = \frac{PP_{rs}-PP_{rs}_{min}}{PP_{rs}_{max}-PP_{rs}_{min}}$$

- **Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) :** this index was calculated using the three time scales of PCI (1, 3 and 6)

$$SDCI = 0.5\cdot PCI + 0.25 \cdot TCI + 0.25 \cdot VCI$$

***

## Derivation of drought indices

### 1983/1998 - 2015

- **Standardized Precipitation Index ($SPI_{rs}$) :** with the resulting precipitation from the mergin procedure it would be possible to derive an a spatial SPI.

- **Standardized Precipitation Evapotrasnpiration Index ($SPEI_{rs}$) :** with the resulting precipitation and evapotranspiration from the mergin procedure it would be possible to derive an a spatial SPEI.

***

## Data analysis

- Exploratory data analsis od the derived indices
- Different statistics to compare merging products.
- Point to point correlation between vegetation/temperture indices and precipitation.
- Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) between pair of indices vegetation/temperature, vegetation/precipitation and precipitation/temperature

--- #transitions

## TRANSITION STYLES
You can select from different transitions, like: 

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis', comment = NA}
transitions = c("cube", "page", "concave", "zoom", "linear", "fade", "none", "default")
names(transitions) = gsub("^([a-z])", "\\U\\1", transitions, perl = TRUE)
x = sprintf("[%s](?transition=%s#/transitions)", names(transitions), transitions)
cat(paste(x, collapse = ' - '))
```

--- #themes

## Themes

Reveal.js comes with a few themes built in: 

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis', comment = NA}
themes = c("sky", "beige", "simple", "serif", "night", "default", "solarized", "moon")
names(themes) = gsub("^([a-z])", "\\U\\1", themes, perl = TRUE)
x = sprintf("[%s](?theme=%s#/themes)", names(themes), themes)
cat(paste(x, collapse = ' - '))
```

<small>* Theme demos are loaded after the presentation which leads to flicker. In production you should load your theme in the `<head>` using a `<link>`.</small>

## Clever Quotes

These guys come in two forms, inline:  <q>The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from and block:</q>

> For years there has been a theory that millions of monkeys typing at random on millions of typewriters would reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare. The Internet has proven this theory to be untrue.

## Pretty Code

```
function linkify( selector ) {
  if( supports3DTransforms ) {

    var nodes = document.querySelectorAll( selector );

    for( var i = 0, len = nodes.length; i < len; i++ ) {
      var node = nodes[i];

      if( !node.className ) ) {
        node.className += ' roll';
      }
    };
  }
}
```
